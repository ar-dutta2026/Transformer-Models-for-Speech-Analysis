# Encoder Decoder Models

## Instructions
To run the model, you must specify which part of the model you want to run. 
By running python PA2_code/main.py part1 in terminal, it runs the first part of the assignment (the Encoder).
By running python PA2_code/main.py part2 in terminal, it runs the first part of the assignment (the Decoder).

## Details
I created two transformer files, transformercl, contains the code for classifier (Encoder), and transformerdecode has the code for the LM (Decoder).
Main.py contains most of the training loops and runs the sanity checks from utility.py. No other files were edited besides main.py, transformercl.py and transformerdecoder.py.
I have also included a report discussing all my findings based upon the requirements of the assignement.
